          <span>My Bubu,</span>
          <br />
          They say a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, <br/>
          but I think they just hadn't met you yet! You’re the 'rose' in my life.
          You are cute, unique, and the best part of my day. I wanted to send you 
          something special to kick off Valentine's week because you deserve all the 
          beauty in the world. May your day be filled with as much joy as you’ve brought
          into my heart since the moment we met. <br/>
          Happy Rose Day, bubudi!!
